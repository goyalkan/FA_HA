I designed and implemented a 4-bit Vedic multiplier using a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) with variations in full adders, including designs using half adders and logic gates such as XOR, XNOR, etc. To optimize performance, I conducted a comparative analysis of power consumption through Verilog simulations on the Xilinx Vivado platform, achieving the lowest power consumption with the XOR-based full adder design
